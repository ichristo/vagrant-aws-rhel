vagrant-aws-rhel
================
##Prerequisites

###Install Homebrew
If you're a Linux user, then you're familiar with using package managers
to install software packages.  This is clearly one of the missing
features for OS X and there have been several attempts out there to fill
the gap.  

Created by [Max Howell](http://mxcl.github.io/),
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is one of the package management options
that we'll use for installing the necessary packages on OS X.  

You can determine whether or not it is already installed with this:

    $ which brew

If you see something like the following then it is already installed:

    /usr/local/bin/brew

If you don't get any output then you probably do not have it installed or else
it is not in your current PATH variable.


If it is already installed and you want to check the version do this:

    $ brew --version
    0.9.5

To install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), simple run the install script
via curl and ruby:

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go/install)"

The script explains what it will do and then pauses before it does it. 



###Install Brew-Cask
Yes, "clicking and dragging " an icon via Mac OS DMG-style packages is
incredible simple.  But what if we could download and install software
via the command-line.  Or even better, run a script to install AND
configure the application in one simple step.

Well, through the magic of Open Source, there's a tool for that called
[brew-cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask). This tool, written
by [Paul Hinze](http://phinze.com) provides a simple
[CLI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) workflow for
the administration of Mac applications distributed as binaries.

To install it, simply install it via Homebrew:

    $ brew tap phinze/homebrew-cask
    $ brew install brew-cask


### Install Vagrant
[Vagrant](www.vagrantup.com) is a tool written by [Mitchell
Hashimoto](http://mitchellh.com/) to streamline the process of
provisioning virtual instances. By using vagrant, developers can rapidly
create an isolated environment to deploy and test applications on their
local machines.

Originially, Vagrant only supported VirtualBox, put today extensions
exist for AWS & VMWare environments as well.  Imagine the value of
deploying an application the same way in Amazon's EC2 that you do on
your local machine ... all within a few minutes.

You can download the installation package from the [Vagrant Download
page](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/). If you're using Homebrew and
Casks, its as simple as this:

    $ brew cask install vagrant
    
    ==> Downloading http://files.vagrantup.com/packages/a40522f5fabccb9ddabad03d836e12
    ==> Running installer for vagrant; your password may be necessary.
    ==> installer: Package name is Vagrant
    ==> installer: Upgrading at base path /
    ==> installer: The upgrade was successful.
    ==> Success! vagrant installed to /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/vagrant/1.3.5
    
    
    
### Install the Vagrant AWS Related Plugins
Vagrant can be used to manage EC2 and VPC instances via the [vagrant-aws
plugin](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws).  There are also some extra plugins 
that help in getting additional information and adding some configurations.

After installing this plugin, it will be possible to do the following
via vagrant:

* Boot EC2 or VPC instances.
* SSH into the instances.
* Provision the instances with any built-in Vagrant provisioner.
* Minimal synced folder support via rsync.
* Define region-specifc configurations so Vagrant can manage machines in
  multiple regions.

To install the Vagrant AWS Plugin, simply do the following:

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws
    
    Installing the 'vagrant-aws' plugin. This can take a few
     minutes...
    Installed the plugin 'vagrant-aws (0.4.0)'!
	
The Vagrant AWS Extras plugin allows you to add A Record entries to Domains managed as part of Amazon's Route53 DNS Service.  

	$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws-extras
	Installing the 'vagrant-aws-extras' plugin. This can take a few minutes...
	Installed the plugin 'vagrant-aws-extras (0.1.0)'!
	
	

## Creating the AWS Instances
### Configure the Hosted Zone
In Amazon, make sure to configure the 'Hosted Zone' for the image.  Instructions for getting started are available at [Amazon's Route 53 Documentation Site](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/R53Example.html)


### Configure the AWS Settings
Copy the aws.example.yml in the config directory to aws.yml.
Modify the settings with the correct AWS settings:

    aws:
      ami: 'ami-a25415cb'   #RHEL 6 AMI
      subnet_id: '{SUBNET FROM THE VPC}'
      access_key_id     : '{YOUR_ACCESS_KEY}YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'
      secret_access_key : '{YOUR_SECRETACCESS_KEY}'
      keypair_name      : '{YOUR_KEYPAIR_NAME}'
      security_groups   : [ 'default' ]
      region: 'us-east-1'region
      pemfile: '{YOUR_PEM_FILE}'
      user_data: "#!/bin/bash\necho 'Defaults:ec2-user !requiretty' >
/etc/sudoers.d/999-vagrant-cloud-init-requiretty && chmod 440
/etc/sudoers.d/999-vagrant-cloud-init-requiretty\n"   

In the user_data section, we are disabling the 'requiretty' setting for the ec2_user.  This is necessary for Red Hat flavors of Linux (Amazon, Centos, Fedora, RHEL) and without it we'll get the error:

    sudo: sorry, you must have a tty to run sudo
    
Disabling the requiretty setting for the ec2-user resolves this error.  If we are using a user for sudo besides the 'ec2-user' then modify the command as necessary.

#### Configure the Vagrant Boxes

In the Vagrantfile, Verify that the hostnames and number of boxes is
correct.

    boxes = [
      { 
        :name           =>  'ose-broker-01',
        :ip             =>  '192.168.200.101',
        :primary        =>  'true',
        :instance_type  =>  't1.micro'
      },
      { 
        :name           =>  'ose-node-01',
        :ip             =>  '192.168.200.121',
        :primary        =>  'false',
        :instance_type  =>  't1.micro'
      },
      { 
        :name           =>  'ose-node-02',
        :ip             =>   '192.168.200.122',
        :primary        =>  'false',
        :instance_type  =>  't1.micro'
      },
      
    ]
    
### Run It!
Run the following from your project root to create the AWS instances:

    $ vagrant up --provider=aws

And there you have it ! 

You can ssh into the primary instance with the following: â€“

    $ vagrant ssh 

To ssh into the secondary instances:

    $ vagrant ssh ose-node-01
    
To 'TERMINATE' the EC2 instances:

    $ vagrant destroy ose-broker-01 ose-node-01 ose-node-02
	Are you sure you want to destroy the 'ose-node-02' VM? [y/N] y
	WARNING: Nokogiri was built against LibXML version 2.8.0, but has dynamically loaded 2.9.1
	[ose-node-02] Terminating the instance...
	Are you sure you want to destroy the 'ose-node-01' VM? [y/N] y
	[ose-node-01] Terminating the instance...
